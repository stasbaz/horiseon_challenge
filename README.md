# 01 README FOR HORISEON PROJECT

## Challenges that I passed
```
Made a codebase that meets accessibility standards
The site is optimized for search engines
```

## Criteria I meet

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Final version

Final version should correspond to this demo, which I did
